echo '<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Information Security emphasis (also referred to as “Cybersecurity”) 
will introduce you to principles and concepts of information security and hacking. 
Coursework uses real-world examples to illustrate attacks on computer systems and networks and teaches you basic hacking concepts with defensive measures. As a computer scientist, you’ll also need to be more than technically proficient. Reading, writing, critical analysis and presentation skills are essential for those who wish to do more than develop software. 
The dynamic blend of Western’s liberal arts and computer science courses will provide you with the hard and soft skills necessary to manage people and projects.

To start building your resume, you can apply for competitive, paid internships with Lockheed Martin, Amazon, Northrup Grumman and more. 
For opportunities on-campus, you can work for the Western IT Department and help protect the university’s cyber network. 
Due to the increasing demand for this skillset, you’ll enter the workforce prepared for challenging work and great career opportunities.</p>
